    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const players2 = players;
    console.log(players, players2);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    players2[2] = 'fakeNews';
    console.log(players, players2);

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log('oh shit both arrays changed')

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players3 = players.slice();
    players3[0] = 'bigNips';
    console.log(players, players3, 'that fixed it');

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const players4 = [].concat(players);
    players4[1] = 'massiveNips';
    console.log(players, players4);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const players5 = [...players];
    players5[0] = 'WAP';
    console.log(players, players5);

    //another way:
    const players6 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    let josh = person;
    josh.name = 'josh';
    josh.age = 99;
    console.log(person, josh);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    josh = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 49, dickSize: 'massive' });
    console.log(person, josh);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // doesn't work for an object within an object...
    const jbaby = Object.assign({}, josh, { hobbies: {'fireStarting': 'great', 'fireExtinguishing': 'notGreat' }})
    let Obama = Object.assign({}, jbaby);
    Obama.hobbies.fireExtinguishing = 'terrible';
    console.log(jbaby, Obama);
    console.log('it changed both peoples hobbies!!!');

    //workaround:
    Obama = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(jbaby));
    Obama.hobbies.fireExtinguishing = 'abysmal';
    console.log(jbaby, Obama);
